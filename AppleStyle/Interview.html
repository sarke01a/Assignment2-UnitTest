<h1> I.T WORK </h1>
<h2> Interview with Daniel Atanasovski- </h2>
<p> The IT job field is vast, intriguing, and forever growing, sometimes it can feel conceptual and beyond our means, but we were lucky enough to have connections through to people at Google in which we had the privilege of interviewing Daniel Atanasovski.
</p>
<h3> What kinds of work is done by the IT professional? </h3>
<p> In our interview with Daniel Atanasovski on the 30th of March 2021, we learnt that he works in the automotive advanced technology industry and is a System Engineering Manager at Google for the Waymo Project. There are different groups that concentrate on different aspects of the self-driving car. Specifically, his group concentrates on the systems engineering activities, which they integrate the self-driving system on to, making sure his team carries out the modifications to regular automobiles and making them appropriate to be able to then plug in the software which makes the cars self-driving.
 </p>
<h3> What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?  Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h3>
<p> Daniel and his team need to communicate with people in the hardware organisation and the software organisation, people in operations and product mangers. Daniel categorised the people that he communicates with as, Developers, Product managers, Operations people, and administrative teams such as the legal teams and communications team. According to Daniel, Google and Waymo are very collaborative and so Daniel states that the ideas they come up with, come from an array of people, for e.g., middle managers, experts from different subject areas, and not just from CEO’s.
</p>
<p> Daniel and his team generally interact with the internal engineering teams, also the car company teams in which they develop the cars with together and not so much their clients or investors as such.
</p>
<h3> Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </h3>
<p> Daniel works in quite a large team, approximately 20 people. In this team he manages and plans the major work streams and organises his team’s quality output. He needs to be quite communicative with his team to make sure they are on the right track and working efficiently and achieving their goals. One of Daniels main roles is also reviewing, auditing, and approving works from his team.
</p>
<h3> What aspects of their position is most challenging? </h3>
<p> Making the self-driving cars perceive the world as a human would, in respect to autonomy for e.g., hearing and seeing things from the left, front and right of the car, is one of the most difficult challenges of Daniels work as a system engineer at google for the Waymo project. Also, another challenging aspect of his work is being able to prove that the automobile is safe enough, so that it can drive on its own without a human’s input. Making modifications, and not compromising the fuel efficiency of the vehicle or making it unsafe. Also making sure there is still enough space for passengers as there are lots of important components needed to make it efficient in self-driving, such as, batteries and computers, this is another obstacle faced. His team tends to follow a procedure of things that could go wrong and eliminating them one at a time and making reasonable mitigations.
</p>
<h3> Some background knowledge from Daniel and past work experience. </h3>
<p> Daniel has had a remarkably interesting career so far. In his past he had an automotive background and he worked for Ford, Toyota internationally, where he worked on the Hilux and Landcruiser and he even worked at Tesla in Silicon Valley. Working at Tesla is where his Technological career transitioned in which then Google found Daniel.
</p>
<p> The main differences that Daniel noticed when working at a conventional automotive company to then working at a technological automotive company is that the conventional automotive companies use a waterfall development process in which things can take up to 4 years for a car to be released and the technological automotive company uses software, in which things progress a lot quicker, in which they work in 2-week sprints rather than a waterfall sequential method, which takes a lot longer. This is where Daniel outlines one of the elements that captures the I.T essence in his work experience.
</p>
<p> Radars and Lidars have been around for some time, but in the last 10 years these technologies have been accelerated and Daniel believes its due to the technology of self-driving cars pushing this technology. Machine learning was not readily available before self-driving cars, such as deep neural networks, which has seriously emerged only in the last 5-6 years and has been developed during the Waymo project, according to Daniel.
</p>
<p> We discussed with Daniel our Group project idea as being a Drive Aware app, mainly conceptual for the use of truck drivers and monitoring their vital signs and physical signs of fatigue or lack of concentration while driving and being monitored with a wearable device. Daniel advised us that there was in fact companies who have created a similar technology called ‘Seeing Machines.’ They are an Australian company based in NSW, which monitor fatigue through cameras that record movements in your eyes and head movements. Also, Daniel states that now some car companies use this technology from ‘Seeing Machines’ or are developing their own such as Tesla who has developed a camera inside the car that looks at your eyes and has a similar algorithm that monitors Fatigue. But in saying that Daniel assures us he has not seen any wearable tracking device for fatigue or monitoring biometrics to predict danger while driving, which seems promising.
</p>
<p> Daniel advised us that Waymo also has self-driving trucks to get cargo around but has signified that they are familiar with the challenges of truckdrivers. Daniel believes the function of driver monitoring is important because the system is doing all the driving and is more important that the driver is being monitored in case of an emergency because they are not as engaged as they would be if they were driving the truck themselves. </p>
<p> We highly enjoyed our interview with Daniel Atanasovski, he has had a remarkably interesting career and has lots of knowledge that can help us with our group project. We, as a team are extremely satisfied with how the interview with Daniel went, we are very appreciative of his time and his detailed answers to our extensive questions. Daniel has taught us all some lessons we believe we can all walk away today, with new knowledge about IT and autonomous cars and how Google works internally as a company. There is a lot of work that goes into the technology behind the Waymo project, and Daniel has done a great job outlining processes and procedures taken to complete his work.
