        <p>Welcome to the Drive Aware Tech Team (DAT Team) group page.
          Drive Aware is our teams proposed project that will be developed in-line with RMIT's Introduction to Information Technology assessment work.
          Our aim is to develop Drive Aware from theoretically stage to tangible results towards a working prototype.  
          Drive Aware is an App based project which will work in conjunction with wearable technology to track and monitor a users biometric vital signs
          and fatigue indicators associated with long periods of sustained driving.</p>

            <h4 style="text-align:left;">BACKGROUND</h4>
             <p style="text-align:left;">I have worked for the same company since 1997 and live with my two adult children in northern suburbs of Melbourne. I have lived in Melbourne all my life.
              My hobbies include learning new things, reading, crosswords, sudoku & card/board games.<br>
              My interest in IT stems from the feeling and excitement I get from learning new things.  The very nature of technology is forever changing and evolving so it can never get boring.  You just cannot ever know ‘everything’.<br>
              My experience in IT ranges from data entry to tech lead/implementation lead, development, training delivery and project management (on a small scale). I have worn many hats since I joined the workforce back in the 80s and majority of the roles involved some form of computer interaction.<br>
              My current role as an IT Implementation Lead involves coordinating with many different IT specialists and teams to implement the job for delivery to the customer. The specialist roles I engage with range from Developers, Analysts, Architects, Network specialists, etc. I love to learn about the different aspects from our business perspective because it amazes me what can be achieved.<br>
              My strengths would have to be my Communication skills, Organisational skills and my enthusiasm for learning.  I believe with effort you can figure out most things.

              <br><br>
              On review of my test outcomes, I think some of the key points that would be helpful for the team are:<br>
              <strong>Conscientiousness</strong> <em>(Big 5)</em> (Result: 87/100) – I agree 100%.  I care a lot about my work and how people see me.  I do not work well in a disorganised or haphazard environment, so usually end up organising everyone to help it work. <br>
              <strong>Dutiful and very responsible </strong> <em>(16 Personalities)</em> (Result – Logistician)– definitely take my responsibilities very seriously.  I do not like to let anyone down. <br>
              <strong>Honest & Direct</strong> <em>(16 Personalities) (Result – Logistician) </em>– can be misconstrued as blunt or insensitive. I work on this aspect and work on filtering my first thoughts into a more presentable way so that it does not come across as blunt or insensitive.<br>
              
              I would think the above results will show the group that I can be relied upon to not only do my share but always aim to deliver what is required in a timely manner.  I am not one to leave things to the last minute or procrastinate.<br><br>
              In regard to the Honest & Direct feedback, although I can agree that it might be part of my personality profile, it is not something that is a huge issue in my daily life.  When I was younger I was probably a bit more prone to speaking out without thinking.  In my wisdom, I have found much better ways to communicate and work really well in a team environment. <br><br>
              In relation to the learning style, it would be more beneficial for the group to understand that I learn better and engage better when I see or do something.  So explaining an issue verbally is not always helpful to me.  (This conflicts with the results that state I learn mainly by hearing and doing)<br>

              <h4 style="text-align:left;">BACKGROUND</h4>
               <p style="text-align:left;">I am a mother to three daughters and married to a System Engineer, who has his own business. He concentrates on managing client’s servers 
                and I.T networks for their business’s, also he does contract work for the state government and ambulance Victoria. My goal is to achieve enough knowledge to feel confident 
                enough to be able to assist my husband to allow him to grow his business further. I have been a hairdresser for 14 years and have come from a family of hairdressers, so it came
                very naturally to me. As I mature, I regret not furthering my studies from my VCE but have decided it is not too late.  <br>
                
                Everything technology related interests me from biomedical engineering to autonomous cars to even cloud-based storage, especially for precious photos we accumulate. 
                I feel technology is everywhere from our navigation in our cars to our virtual assistants, google home. Using YouTube and Netflix has become even easier now being 
                accessible via our remote controls and viewed on our smart TV’s. It is quite hard to escape technology in this day in age, its literally in the palm of our hands with 
                our smartphones giving us access to the internet wherever we are. It is simply amazing, and since starting this course it has opened my eyes to the possibilities that 
                technology can create.  <br><br>
                
                We are quite tech savvy in our family, also having a husband in I.T has given me some knowledge about cloud computing, servers and managing business’s IT needs. I enjoy
                using social media to communicate with friends and family and using cloud-based apps such as Google photos to store photos and videos. I love editing my photos to make 
                them more appealing with altering the light, contrast, and shadows. I know how to do all basic functions of scanning, emails, using both windows and apple Mac PC’s and 
                laptops. I am always eager to learn something new and this course has shown me that I only know a small percentage of what I.T is. Since starting Introduction to 
                Technology, I am even more intrigued to learn and grow, and so far, I am really enjoying this course.  <br><br>
                
                In my spare time, (which does not occur these days) I love painting portraits or landscapes on canvas. I love learning new things and growing my knowledge. I love going
                to the beach, spending quality time with family and friends and having a laugh. I love having bonfires and roasting marshmallows with my kids. As much as I love technology
                 I like to disconnect sometimes and recharge.

                After reviewing my Personality test results, they show that I work well in groups, as the traits show.<br> <br>
                
                According to the <strong>DISC Assessment</strong>, I'm an <strong>Influence</strong> personality type which engages others and shares enthusiasm, inspires and 
                persuades others. <br>
                
                According to <strong>16 personalities</strong>, I'm an <strong>ENFJ-T Turbulent Protagonist</strong>, I care about helping and connecting with others and rather 
                cooperate then compete, I also have empathy for others and like deep conversations. <br>
                
                According to <strong> Personality Perfect</strong>, I am <strong>ENFJ-The Giver</strong>, I am influential, loyal, reliable, genuine, passionate, reflective, warm, 
                caring and communicate well.  <br><br>
                
                I agree with these tests results and all these traits can help me be a good team member as I care about the wellbeing of everyone and want to work together to get the
                best result. I like motivating and encouraging my group members and I like to help them in any way I can, may it be to help organise or share ideas or simply show encouragement. 
                I like to get the reassurance back from my group members that they are satisfied with my efforts, this also shows me that I need good communication between my group members.   </p>
